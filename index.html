						<!--
						My name is Jaden. I am a software engineer and game designer who recently graduated from the NYU Game Center. I enjoy making games involving systems-driven emergent interactions and narrative, and games informed by sociology, environmental science, and climate solutions.
						I enjoy building simulations and highly emergent systems for games and other software.
						Someday I'd like to work on software that tackles climate change, and I'm already building games that communicate climate solutions.
						I'm also interested in environmental systems science and sociology.
