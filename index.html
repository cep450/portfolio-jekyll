	Hi, I'm Jaden. I'm a software engineer, game developer, and recent graduate of the NYU Game Center.
</p>
<p>
	I'm a software engineer at heart and I like designing and building extensible emergent simulation systems for games and anything else.
</p>
	I'm particularly interested in science and climate solutions and communicating them through games.
